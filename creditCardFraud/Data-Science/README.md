Undergraduated in Civil Engineering from PUC Minas, on the Poços de Caldas campus. During college courses, I took some programming classes and was immediately attracted to the area, but I only had the opportunity to return to programming studies after finishing my degree. Currently, I have focused my studies in the areas of data science, analyzing topics of various subjects.
